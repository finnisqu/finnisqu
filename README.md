# I am Finnis.

I graduated with an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Brigham Young University.
I first got into programming when a professor hired me to help upload his logic textbook to a WordPress site. I started watching YouTube videos and doing tutorials. I also learned a lot from freeCodeCamp.
I hope to use my programming skills in my career. I have worked almost exclusively with JavaScript and Python so far.
