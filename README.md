# I am Finnis. 
---
I graduated with an undergraduate degree in philosophy from Brigham Young University.
I got into programming when a professor hired me to help upload his logic textbook to a WordPress site. I started watching YouTube videos and doing tutorials. I also learned a lot from freeCodeCamp.
I hope to use my programming skills in my career.

Goals:
- [X] Create a game
- [ ] Finish freeCodeCamp's courses
- [ ] Collaborate with someone on a project
